## General info
The program stores personal contacts. You can add new contacts, view all, search them by name, id, or phone number,
delete contacts or edit them. Some restrictions are added for example you can't add a contact with the same phone number
or email. 

I made this to practice my python programming skills and ability to design a GUI.
